# Adding Milvus service
Last Updated: 2024-07-03
Milvus is a vector database that stores, indexes, and manages massive embedding vectors that are developed by deep neural networks and other machine learning (ML) models. It is developed to empower embedding similarity search and AI applications. Milvus makes unstructured data search more accessible and consistent across various environments.

## Procedure
- Complete the following steps to add Milvus as a service in IBMÂ® watsonx.data.
  - Log in to the watsonx.data console.
  - From the navigation menu, select Infrastructure Manager.
